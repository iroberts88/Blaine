Hey you read me!  Ripped and cleaned up by Celebi.  The only pain in the
neck sound was amnesia/confusion/mimic.  The music ingame would change
the tone of these sounds depending on the last note played.  
Any sounds that have anything after their original name are extra. 
(Except the obvious three mentioned sounds above)  If a sound has "direct" 
after its name, that means I was unsure if the created sound from combining 
all the parts of the sound, sounded the same to the direct version. 
(So its there for comparison)  There some extras here and there.
